The current Page is noticeable by which icon on the bar is blacked out. In order from top to bottom the first button is to the Sync Page then the Stock Page and finally the Wiki Page.

Another way the user can transverse around the app is to use the search mechanics respectively inside of the Stock Page to search for each stock and the Wiki Page to search for game terms, things, Places, People and so forth.
